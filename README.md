## Folder Structure

- **/app**
  - **/page.js** - The main index page rendered on the server. Currently, it's minimal, with plans to split server/client components as needed. Each page will wrap the `Provider` (placed in the same directory as `provider.js`).
  - **/provider.js** - Contains all client-side logic shared across components on the page, reducing the need for prop drilling.
  - **/components** - Holds client-side components for the page, which can access page data via the `provider.js` file.
  
- **/components**
  - **/elements** - Common components used across the app (e.g., Table, Select, Input, Card components).
  - **/ui** - Generated by the Shadcn/UI library.
  
- **/hooks** - Contains all custom hooks used across the app (currently includes `useFetch` for fetching data from APIs).
  
- **/lib** - Generated by the Shadcn/UI library.
  
- **/public**
  - **/data** - Contains mock data for sectors, stocks, and historical performance.
